    local variable scope, especially how local variables interact with method invocations with blocks and method definitions
    mutating vs non-mutating methods, pass-by-reference vs pass-by-value
    working with collections (Array, Hash, String), and popular collection methods (each, map, select, etc). Review the two lessons on these topics thoroughly.
    variables as pointers
    puts vs return
    false vs nil and the idea of "truthiness"
    method definition and method invocation
    implicit return value of method invocations and blocks
    how the Array#sort method works
